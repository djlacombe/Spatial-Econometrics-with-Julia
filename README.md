# Spatial-Econometrics-with-Julia
This repository will contain code 
for spatial econometric models in Julia.

# Update (2/1/2022): 
I will be adding code to the repository soon. 
* The code will be alpha version, meaning that the code works, but may need additional tweaks before putting it out for full distribution.
